# Q-Learning Agent Simulation

This project provides a simulation where an agent moves on a grid using the **Q-Learning** algorithm. The agent learns to reach a specific goal using a reward and penalty system. The project allows the agent to learn what actions to take using the **Q-Table** and performs these actions at each step.

### Features
- The agent learns using the **Q-Learning** algorithm.
- The agent moves on a grid and takes steps to reach a goal.
- The agent's movements include `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `up-right`, `up-left`, `down-right`, and `down-left` diagonal directions.
- Simulates obstacles and a goal.
- During the training process, the agent is guided by rewards and penalty values.

### Project Structure

- **`game.py`**: The main simulation file containing the Q-Learning algorithm.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the Python libraries required for the project.
- **`README.md`**: Information about the project and usage instructions.
